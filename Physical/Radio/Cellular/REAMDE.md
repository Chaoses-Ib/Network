> The term **cellular** refers to the fact that the region covered by a cellular network is partitioned into a number of geographic coverage areas, known as **cells**. Each cell contains a **base station** that transmits signals to, and receives signals from, the **mobile devices** currently in its cell. The coverage area of a cell depends on many factors, including the transmitting power of the base station, the transmitting power of the devices, obstructing buildings in the cell, and the height and type of the base station antennas.[^topdown]

  The mobile device has a globally unique 64-bit identifier called the **International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)**, which is stored on its **SIM (Subscriber Identity Module)** card.[^topdown]
