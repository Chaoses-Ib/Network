## Electrical Communication
In short-distance and relatively low-bandwidth applications, electrical transmission is often preferred because of its[^fiber-wiki]:

- Lower material cost, where large quantities are not required
- Lower cost of transmitters and receivers
- Capability to carry electrical power as well as signals (in appropriately designed cables)
- Ease of operating transducers in linear mode.

Comparison between twisted-pair cables and coaxial cables[^sparklight]:
- Coaxial cables are generally used for cable television and internet connections.
- Twisted pair cables are usually used for telephone connections.
- Coaxial cables support greater cable lengths.
- Twisted pair cables are thinner and less expensive.
- Coaxial cables are better shielded from crosstalk.
- Twisted pair cables provide high transmission rates.
