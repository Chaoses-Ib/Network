# Reverse DNS Lookup
**A reverse DNS lookup (reverse DNS resolution, rDNS)** is the querying technique of the DNS to determine the domain name associated with an IP address â€“ the reverse of the usual "forward" DNS lookup of an IP address from a domain name.

The process of reverse resolving of an IP address uses [PTR records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTR_record). rDNS involves searching domain name registry and registrar tables. The reverse DNS database of the Internet is rooted in the [.arpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.arpa) top-level domain.[^wiki]
