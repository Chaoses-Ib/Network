The component WSDMON in Windows 7 and later uses WS-Discovery to automatically discover WSD-enabled network printers, which show in Network in Windows Explorer, and can be installed by double-clicking on them. In Windows 8 or later installation is automatic. WS-Discovery is enabled by default in networked HP printers since 2008. WS-Discovery is an integral part of [Windows Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Rally) technologies and [Devices Profile for Web Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devices_Profile_for_Web_Services).
