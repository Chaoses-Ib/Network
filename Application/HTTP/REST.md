The six guiding principles or constraints of the RESTful architecture are:
- Uniform interface
  - Identification of resources
  - Manipulation of resources through representations
  - Self-descriptive messages
  - Hypermedia as the engine of application state
- Client-server
- Stateless
- Cacheable
- Layered system
- Code on demand (optional)
