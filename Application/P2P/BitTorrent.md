> BitTorrent is a popular P2P protocol for file distribution. In BitTorrent lingo, the collection of all peers participating in the distribution of a particular file is called a **torrent**. Peers in a torrent download equal-size **chunks** of the file from one another, with a typical chunk size of 256 KBytes.[^topdown]

## Trackers
> Each torrent has an infrastructure node called a **tracker**. When a peer joins a torrent, it registers itself with the tracker and periodically informs the tracker that it is still in the torrent. In this manner, the tracker keeps track of the peers that are participating in the torrent. A given torrent may have fewer than ten or more than a thousand peers participating at any instant of time.[^topdown]
