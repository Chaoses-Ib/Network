# Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)
[Accessing network applications with WSL | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/networking)

## NAT mode
```pwsh
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=<yourPortToForward> listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=<yourPortToConnectToInWSL> connectaddress=(wsl hostname -I)
```
`connectaddress=(wsl hostname -I)` doesn't work on Windows 21H2 (20348.2700) + WSL v2.3.26.0, but `connectaddress=127.0.0.1` works (when the ports are different)?

## Mirrored mode
> On machines running Windows 11 22H2 and higher you canÂ [setÂ `networkingMode=mirrored`Â underÂ `[wsl2]`Â in theÂ `.wslconfig`Â file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#configuration-settings-for-wslconfig)Â to enable mirrored mode networking. Enabling this changes WSL to an entirely new networking architecture which has the goal of 'mirroring' the network interfaces that you have on Windows into Linux, to add new networking features and improve compatibility.

Here are the current benefits to enabling this mode:
- IPv6 support
- Connect to Windows servers from within Linux using the localhost addressÂ `127.0.0.1`. IPv6 localhost addressÂ `::1`Â is not supported
- Improved networking compatibility for VPNs
- Multicast support
- Connect to WSL directly from your local area network (LAN)

Available in Windows 21H2 WSL Settings, but not actually working?

## Bridge mode
`%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig`:
```ini
[wsl2]
networkingMode=bridged
vmSwitch=My WSL Switch
```
See [NIC Bridge mode ðŸ–§ Â· Issue #4150 Â· microsoft/WSL](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150#issuecomment-1018524753) for details.

## Network is unreachable
Symptoms:
```sh
$ ping 8.8.8.8
ping: connect: Network is unreachable
```
```sh
$ ip addr
...
6: eth0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 5c:bb:f6:9e:ee:f0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

Possible reasons:
- You are using [bridge mode](#bridge-mode) and the virtual switch was broken however
  
  Bridging to VMware's VMnet and then updating VMware may cause this problem. The broken switch will be displayed as an internal switch in the Virtual Switch Manager.

  The solution is to fix the virtual switch to an external one.
